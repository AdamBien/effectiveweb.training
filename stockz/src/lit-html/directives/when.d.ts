 * Efficiently switches between two templates based on the given condition. The
 * rendered content is cached, and re-used when switching conditions. Templates
 * are evaluated lazily, so the passed values must be functions.
 *
 * While this directive can render any regular part, it makes the most sense
 * when used with TemplateResulte since most other values are dirty checked
 * already.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * let checked = false;
 *
 * html`
 *   when(checked, () => html`Checkmark is checked`, () => html`Checkmark is not
 * checked`);
 * `
 *
 * @param condition the condition to test truthiness against
 * @param trueValue the value to render given a true condition
 * @param falseValue the value to render given a false condition
